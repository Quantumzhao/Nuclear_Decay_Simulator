# Nuclear_Decay_Simulator
It is basically a console application, which prints a matrix on console output, simulating the spontaneous decay process. 

By using a geometric distribution approximating to exponential distribution for every single nucleus, I am trying to approach the realistic nature of nuclear decay. 

Although the model might not be precise eithermathmatically or physically, it is an intriguing application application after all. 

It is still in developement. The so called "Revive Factor" may appearto be very strange. In fact, it has nothing to do with physics indeed, but it is another guess I made. By setting this factor to a decimal that is almost 1, say 0.99, a facinating phenomenom  can be observed (At least I suppose it to be), which is called "Malkov Chain". I'm considering removing this functionality from the simulator in the future.
